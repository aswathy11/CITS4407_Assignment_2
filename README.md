This Project focuses on using bash script for cleaning and organising the file contents of the 3 given files from the Gallup world happiness surveys.

The cleaned file is then used to get a best predictor variable, by finding the correlation with the cantril score.

The main emphasis of this project is the use of awk, sed and join.
